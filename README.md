Project Description: EJS Tags Web Application
üåê Deployed Web Application: [Link to Your Deployed App]

I developed the EJS Tags Web Application, a dynamic webpage showcasing my skills in building web applications using Express.js and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templating engine. The application displays real-time data, including the title, current second, a list of fruits (if the second is even), and custom HTML content. The project highlights my proficiency in web development, JavaScript, and front-end technologies.

‚ú® Key Features:

Dynamic rendering of content using EJS templates.
Real-time display of the title and current second.
Conditionally showing a list of fruits when the current second is even.
Rendering custom HTML content with proper escaping.
Responsive design and user-friendly interface.
üîß Technologies Used:

Express.js: A fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A templating engine for rendering dynamic content on the server-side.
HTML5 & CSS3: Front-end technologies for structuring and styling the application.
JavaScript: Programming language used for interactive features and logic.
Git & GitHub: Version control and collaboration for seamless development.
